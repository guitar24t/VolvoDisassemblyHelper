VolvoDisassemblyHelper
======================

A small AutoIt script to help with disassembling Volvo ME7 BIN files.
Both the script file and an executable are included. Use the executable if you do not have or do not wish to download and install the AutoIt toolkit.

Usage Instructions:

1) Open the executable

2) Open IDA (The script will automatically begin running)

3) Once IDA and the script GUI load, click on the Load BIN file button and follow the instructions. While the script is running, do not use the mouse or keyboard unless a dialog box is displayed on the screen for more than a few seconds.

4) A message box will appear once the initial setup is completed. You may now begin analysis of the code by clicking the Start Analysis button. Use this on sections that look like code. When you reach dead space, click stop all. Once you have defined your code sections, you may go back and cleanup sections that were disassembled to code, but are not actually code. Good luck!
